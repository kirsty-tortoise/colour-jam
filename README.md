# Colour flip

This is a game that we made for a game jam in Guildford in August 2016. The theme of the game jam was colour.

## Installing and running the game

To run the game, you will need love2d installed. You can get that [here](https://love2d.org/).

Now you can download or clone this repository.

Either drag the entire folder on to the LOVE icon which has probably appeared on your desktop, or from the command line change directory into the code folder and type "love ."

A window should magically appear, and the game should start. Now you can play! Yay!

## Playing the game rules

So, the aim of the game is to capture your opponents flag as many times as possible, or at least more times than they capture yours. This is a game for several players (local multiplayer) and you are in teams (possibly a team of 1, but a team nevertheless).

You will either be on the green team or the blue team. You can only move on squares of your colour. Pressing your flip button (which you will be informed of before the game) will change all the squares except yours in your row, column or area, depending on what flip mode you choose at the beginning of the game. Pressing your arrow keys or moving the joystick thing will move you around the grid.

The aim is to get your opponents flag from their base, and move it back to your base. However, if you are ever on a square when someone else flips it, you will drop the flag and move back to your base. Touching your own dropped flag will return it to its base, touching the opponent's flag will pick it up. That's about it.

You can also play with playstation controllers or similar. To do this, plug them into the USB port on your computer, and hope it all works. If it doesn't, you might have to install drivers. Good luck with that.

Have fun!
